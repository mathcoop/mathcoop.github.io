**Who we are:** The Math CoOp, founded in January 2014, is a group of students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty at Brown who share a common passion for math outreach. We meet on a monthly basis to discuss mathematics and share ideas for presentations at all grade levels.

On this page are some samples of our presentations.  If you are a student or post-doctoral fellow interested in joining the CoOp, or an educator in the New England area who would like one of us to present at your institution, please contact us.  Also, feel free to use these to present to students at schools in your own locality.
